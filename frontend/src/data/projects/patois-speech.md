# Improving Speech to Text for Patois

## Overview

Jamaican Patois (Jamaican Creole) is spoken by millions, yet most speech recognition systems fail to accurately transcribe it. [CaribVoices](http://caribvoices.com/) is our initiative to bridge that gap by developing advanced speech-to-text technology specifically trained on Jamaican Patois.

This project aims to create accessible voice technology that truly understands and represents Caribbean linguistic diversity.

## The Challenge

Traditional speech recognition systems are trained primarily on Standard English and struggle with:
- Patois vocabulary and expressions
- Unique pronunciation patterns
- Code-switching between Patois and Standard English
- Regional variations in dialect

## Our Approach

We're developing a specialized speech recognition model that:
- Understands the linguistic structure of Jamaican Patois
- Accurately transcribes Patois speech patterns
- Handles code-switching naturally
- Recognizes regional variations

## Applications

### Education
- Language learning tools
- Accessibility for Patois speakers
- Preservation of linguistic heritage

### Technology
- Voice assistants that understand Patois
- Transcription services for Jamaican media
- Improved accessibility for Jamaican users

### Cultural Preservation
- Documenting oral traditions
- Creating searchable archives of Patois content
- Supporting linguistic research

## Technology Stack

- Deep learning models for speech recognition
- Custom training datasets featuring Patois speakers
- Advanced acoustic modeling
- Natural language processing for Patois

## Current Progress

Through [CaribVoices](http://caribvoices.com/), we're actively collecting speech data from native Patois speakers and training models to improve accuracy. Our goal is to achieve recognition accuracy comparable to Standard English systems while preserving the authentic voice of Jamaican culture.

## Get Involved

We're looking for:
- Native Patois speakers to contribute voice samples
- Linguists and researchers
- Developers interested in speech recognition
- Partners for data collection and validation
