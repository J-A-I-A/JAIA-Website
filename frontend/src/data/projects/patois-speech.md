# Improving Speech to Text for Patois

## Overview

Jamaican Patois (Jamaican Creole) is spoken by millions, yet most speech recognition systems fail to accurately transcribe it. This project aims to bridge that gap by developing advanced speech-to-text technology specifically trained on Jamaican Patois.

## The Challenge

Traditional speech recognition systems are trained primarily on Standard English and struggle with:
- Patois vocabulary and expressions
- Unique pronunciation patterns
- Code-switching between Patois and Standard English
- Regional variations in dialect

## Our Approach

We're developing a specialized speech recognition model that:
- Understands the linguistic structure of Jamaican Patois
- Accurately transcribes Patois speech patterns
- Handles code-switching naturally
- Recognizes regional variations

## Applications

### Education
- Language learning tools
- Accessibility for Patois speakers
- Preservation of linguistic heritage

### Technology
- Voice assistants that understand Patois
- Transcription services for Jamaican media
- Improved accessibility for Jamaican users

### Cultural Preservation
- Documenting oral traditions
- Creating searchable archives of Patois content
- Supporting linguistic research

## Technology Stack

- Deep learning models for speech recognition
- Custom training datasets featuring Patois speakers
- Advanced acoustic modeling
- Natural language processing for Patois

## Current Progress

We're actively collecting speech data and training models to improve accuracy. Our goal is to achieve recognition accuracy comparable to Standard English systems.

## Get Involved

We're looking for:
- Native Patois speakers to contribute voice samples
- Linguists and researchers
- Developers interested in speech recognition
- Partners for data collection and validation
